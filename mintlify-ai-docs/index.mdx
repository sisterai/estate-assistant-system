This site is a modern, action-oriented documentation layer for EstateWise.

It consolidates and improves the content currently spread across:
- `README.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DEVOPS.md`
- `DEPLOYMENTS.md`
- `RAG_SYSTEM.md`
- `TECH_DOCS.md`

  </Card>
  <Card title="Ship safely" icon="shield-check" href="/ops/devops">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Makes This Version Better

- Source-of-truth commands are pulled from actual `package.json` scripts.
- API references reflect real route registration from backend code.
- AI docs explain not just what exists, but when to use each pathway.
- Operations docs prioritize incident response and delivery safety.

<Tip>
The original documentation files remain unchanged. This site is an additive, Mintlify-native layer.
