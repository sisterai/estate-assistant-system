title: "Agentic Runtime and MCP"
description: "How the standalone agent runtime and MCP tool server extend core chat capabilities."
---

EstateWise includes two key extension layers:

- `agentic-ai/`: orchestration runtime for multi-step goals
- `mcp/`: 60+ tools exposed over MCP stdio

## Runtime architecture

```

## Agentic runtimes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Default orchestrator">
    Deterministic round-based execution over specialized agents.

    ```bash
    cd agentic-ai
    npm run dev "find 3-bed homes in chapel hill under 600k"
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="LangGraph runtime">
    ReAct-style tool-calling workflow.

    ```bash
    cd agentic-ai
    npm run dev:langgraph -- "compare two zpids and explain graph paths"
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CrewAI runtime">
    Crew-based orchestration option.

    ```bash
    cd agentic-ai
    npm run dev:crewai -- "rank properties by affordability and commute"
    ```

  </Tab>

## End-to-end interaction sequence

```mermaid

  participant U as User
  participant AR as Agentic runtime
  participant MCP as MCP server
  participant API as Backend

  U->>AR: goal
  AR->>MCP: tool call
  MCP->>API: REST request
  API-->>MCP: result payload
  MCP-->>AR: tool response
  AR-->>U: synthesized output
```

## Important operational notes

- MCP dev server appears idle until a client connects.
- Graph tools depend on Neo4j-enabled backend.
- Token workflows require `MCP_TOKEN_SECRET` and TTL configuration.
