title: "Hybrid RAG"
description: "Vector retrieval plus graph enrichment for explainable real-estate recommendations."
---

## Why Hybrid RAG

Vector-only retrieval is fast but weak on structural explanations.
Hybrid RAG adds graph relationships so recommendations are both relevant and explainable.

## Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Q[User Query] --> E[Embed Query]
  E --> V[Pinecone Vector Search]
  V --> T[Top-K Properties]
  T --> G[Neo4j Graph Enrichment]
  G --> X[Merge + Dedupe + Rank]
  X --> C[LLM Context]
```

## What the system gains

- Better locality/coherence (same neighborhood/zip patterns).
- Relationship explanations for recommendations.
- Context rich enough for finance/lifestyle/market expert reasoning.

## Graph-driven reasoning examples

- "Recommended because it shares neighborhood and zipcode with your liked property."
- "Related by similarity and local market cluster characteristics."

## Graceful degradation

If Neo4j is disabled or unavailable:
- graph routes return `503`
- chat flow still works with vector-only retrieval

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to favor vector-only mode">
    - Very latency-sensitive interactions
    - No graph infrastructure available
    - Early prototyping where explainability is not yet required
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to require Hybrid RAG">
    - Production recommendation quality work
    - Explainability requirements for users or stakeholders
    - Neighborhood and structural context are core to UX
  </Accordion>

## Operational commands

```bash
cd backend
npm run upsert        # Pinecone ingestion
npm run graph:ingest  # Neo4j ingestion
```
