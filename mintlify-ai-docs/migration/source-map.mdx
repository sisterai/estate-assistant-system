title: "Legacy Source Map"
description: "Mapping from the existing markdown docs set to this AI-native Mintlify documentation structure."
---

This page maps legacy source files to their new documentation homes.

## Source-to-site mapping

| Legacy source | Primary new pages |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | `/index`, `/start/*`, `/reference/commands`, `/reference/endpoints` |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | `/platform/architecture`, `/platform/apis`, `/platform/data-models`, `/platform/repository` |
| `RAG_SYSTEM.md` | `/ai/rag`, `/ai/system`, `/ai/moe` |
| `TECH_DOCS.md` | `/ai/*`, `/platform/*`, `/ops/*`, `/reference/*` |
| `DEVOPS.md` | `/ops/devops`, `/ops/runbooks`, `/ops/slo-dr` |
| `DEPLOYMENTS.md` | `/ops/deployments` |

## What this migration improves

- Consolidates duplicated material into one navigable IA.
- Prioritizes operationally actionable content over long narrative sections.
- Separates AI system behavior from platform and ops concerns.
- Keeps command, endpoint, and config references in dedicated pages.

## Non-destructive guarantee

- Existing markdown docs are not modified.
- This Mintlify site is additive and isolated in `mintlify-ai-docs/`.

<Tip>
If needed, this site can be maintained as a long-term canonical docs layer while legacy markdown remains as archival source material.
