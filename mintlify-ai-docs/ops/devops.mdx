## CI/CD model

EstateWise supports multiple CI/CD entry points:
- Jenkins (primary production orchestrator)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- GitLab CI pipelines

## Strategy matrix

| Strategy | Rollback speed | Resource overhead | Best use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blue-Green | Instant | High during switch | Major releases |
| Canary | Progressive | Moderate | New features and risk-managed rollout |
| Rolling | Standard | Low | Routine updates |

## Blue-Green operational pattern

```bash
export NAMESPACE=estatewise
export AUTO_SWITCH=false
export SCALE_DOWN_OLD=false
./kubernetes/scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh backend ghcr.io/your-org/estatewise-app-backend:v1.2.3
```

## Canary operational pattern

```bash
export NAMESPACE=estatewise
export CANARY_STAGES=10,25,50,75,100
export STAGE_DURATION=120
export AUTO_PROMOTE=false
./kubernetes/scripts/canary-deploy.sh backend ghcr.io/your-org/estatewise-app-backend:v1.2.3
```

## Core Kubernetes operations

```bash
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/base -n estatewise
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/prod -n estatewise
kubectl get deployments,pods,services -n estatewise
kubectl logs -f deployment/estatewise-backend -n estatewise
```

## Monitoring and observability

Key backend observability endpoints:
- `/metrics` (Prometheus)
- `/status` (status monitor UI)

Primary operational signals:
- request latency and error rates
- memory and CPU pressure
- rollout health
- canary and blue/green slot health

<Warning>
Keep deployment checks and rollback commands scripted and rehearsed. Manual, undocumented rollback steps increase MTTR.
</Warning>
